androux port to donut branch

  Though the donut branch is old. The device I am testing on is even older. It happens to be a HTC Dream (The first android device). Please be patient. I promise to move latest android versions as soon as I find devices worthy of it. 
  
  The port isn't complete yet. Also requires you to mount /system on to sdcard to run, as the on board flash is not sufficient.
